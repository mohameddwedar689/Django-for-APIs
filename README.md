# API Development with Python-Django
This repository contains notes and code examples based on my study of API development using Python and Django. The content here includes key concepts, best practices, and hands-on examples from the `Django for APIs` book
I'm currently studying. It serves as both a reference and a learning tool for anyone interested in building robust APIs with Django.
